# Shred-Hour: WIP


The purpose of this project is to quickly find Mountain Biking Trails local to you via MTBProject.com! 
This should pull your location based on Latitude/Longitude and stores this in a config file.

Your location is referenced for pulling Mountain Bike Trails around you, sorting out duplicate locations. 

Using your location, we can pull weather data from the DarkSky API to ensure the weather is going to be great in your location of riding. 


Initially written to be a iOS Shortcut.
